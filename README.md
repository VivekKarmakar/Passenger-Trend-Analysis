 # Passenger Travel Trends Analysis and Visualization

## Introduction
In the fast-paced travel industry, understanding passenger travel trends is essential for making informed decisions. This project aims to analyze and visualize passenger travel trends based on data that includes information about passenger visits to various countries, the month of the visit, and the total number of passengers. We will utilize Power BI to create an insightful dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the trends and patterns in passenger travel.

## DAX Calculation
To effectively analyze the dataset, we will perform the following DAX calculations:
1. Extract the year from the "Month" column.
2. Create a "date" table with the following columns: Date, Year, Month Name, Month Number, Quarter, Weekday, and Week Number using DAX.
3. Perform data modeling between the "Data" table and the "date" table to establish the necessary relationships.

## Measures
We will create a measure table containing the following measures:
1. Total Passengers: Calculate the sum of total passengers.
2. Average Passengers per Month: Compute the average number of passengers per month.
3. Maximum Passengers in a Month: Determine the month with the highest number of passengers.
4. Minimum Passengers in a Month: Identify the month with the lowest number of passengers.
5. Yearly Passenger Trend: Analyze the trend of passenger visits over the years.


## Data Visualization
Utilizing Power BI, we will leverage various charts, graphs, and visuals to present the passenger travel trends in an interactive and engaging manner. The visualization will cover all the required fields related to passenger travel trends, including the country visited, month of visit, and the total number of passengers. The charts will be designed using attention-grabbing colors and themes to enhance the overall appeal and readability of the dashboard.

## Dashboard
The dashboard will provide an intuitive and comprehensive overview of passenger travel trends, allowing users to explore the data dynamically and gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns. The visuals will be carefully crafted to deliver a compelling narrative of the passenger travel landscape.


By effectively combining data analysis, DAX calculations, and visually appealing charts, this project aims to provide a robust understanding of passenger travel trends and empower decision-makers in the travel industry with actionable insights.
